# Covid19-Analysis-by-Tableau

## Data
This project analyzed Canadian COVID-19 total death and total case, and vaccination statistics between 2020 and 2021.

The symbol map on the left illustrates total new case across Canada by the shade of colors. Using this map as a filter, the two graphs on the right hand side can showcase new case statistics by provice. For instance, when we click on Ontario on the map, Ontario daily new case of Covid-19 trend will be shown by line plot. The right bottom barline plot sums up the count of new case in 2020-2021 by month and illustrates the difference of case month over month.

__Insight__: In Ontario, COVID-19 cases followed three major waves: the first in spring 2020, the second in winter 2020, and the third in spring 2021. This pattern is evident in the daily case trend (top-right line plot) and is further supported by the monthly breakdown (bottom-right barline plot).

The highest total new cases occurred in January, April, and May, corresponding to the peak periods of the second and third waves. The sharp increase in April 2021 (127,682 cases) indicates a significant outbreak, with cases rising steeply compared to previous months. Additionally, the percentage change line suggests that some months, such as April, saw drastic spikes, whereas summer months experienced a decline.

This trend aligns with key pandemic events, including lockdown measures, reopening phases, and the emergence of new variants. The seasonal nature of the spikes also suggests that colder months and periods of increased social activity played a role in driving infection rates.

__Insight__:
* Regional Severity:
1. Ontario and Quebec experienced the highest number of new deaths, as shown in the deep red shading on the map. 
2. Other provinces, such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan, also experienced deaths but at lower levels compared to Ontario and Quebec.

* Three Waves of Mortality:
1. The first wave (Spring 2020) had a peak as almost significant as the second wave.
2. The second wave (Winter 2020-2021) was a significant peak, aligning with the major surge in new cases.
3. The third wave (Spring 2021) had a different pattern, with new deaths not rising as sharply as in previous waves, possibly due to vaccination efforts and improved healthcare responses.

__Insight__:
* Trends in New Deaths:
1. The number of new deaths in Ontario followed a similar pattern to new cases, with noticeable peaks in different waves of COVID-19.
2. The highest death toll occurred in May 2021, whereas the peak of new cases was in April 2021. This time lag suggests that deaths typically follow case surges by a few weeks.

* Impact of the Third Wave:
1. Although new cases surged significantly in the third wave, the number of new deaths did not increase at the same rate as in the second wave.
2. This decline in the case-fatality ratio indicates the effectiveness of vaccinations, improved medical treatments, and stronger public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing.
